This code will download files from your chatGPT shared url, to the output directory on your machine!
Since it is downloading code from the internet, please use at your own risk.

dependencies:
ruby

usage:
ruby chat_code <chatGPT url>

testing:
rspec

current goal: getting files to be named the same as they are in the chat. 
TODO: get filename_spec.rb passing - our code only uses the default filename, which is not optimal.
